Dog Breed Identification
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at identifying different dog breeds from images.
The project leverages deep learning models to tackle the multi-class image classification challenge using a dataset of over 10,000 labeled images representing 120 distinct dog breeds.

Project Overview
Dogs have been companions of humanity for centuries, and with over 20,000 recognized breeds, classifying them accurately is a complex task.
This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to automate and simplify the dog breed identification process 
by utilizing transfer learning and data augmentation strategies, aimed to build a highly accurate model for this purpose.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Images are converted to tensor format and resized for model compatibility.
Transfer Learning: The MobileNetV2 architecture is used for efficient feature extraction.
Model Training: The model is trained using TensorFlow and optimized using techniques like early stopping and batch processing.
Evaluation: Predictions are visualized and compared against actual labels to assess model performance.

Methodology
Data Collection: Images and labels are sourced from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset.
Preprocessing: Images are prepared as tensors and divided into training and validation sets.
Model Selection: Transfer learning using MobileNetV2 for efficient and accurate breed classification.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using TensorFlow, the model is trained, validated, and tested, with performance metrics tracked using TensorBoard.
Results: The model achieves high accuracy, and predictions are validated through visual and probabilistic analysis.

Objectives:
Automate the identification of dog breeds from images.
Provide a robust and accurate breed prediction model accessible through web platforms.
Enhance the breed classification process for various practical applications, including veterinary operations, dog competitions, and pet trading.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development.
TensorFlow & Keras: Deep learning frameworks for model building and training.
Google Colab: Platform for executing Python code with free access to GPUs.
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib: Libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
